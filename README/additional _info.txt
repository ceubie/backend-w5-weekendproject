I was able to migrate my text file databases
from last weekends project into MySQL by making
some functions that leveraged for-loops. It took
some extra time, but I was able to figure it out and 
it added some cool tricks to my arsenal.
I have included screenshots of those functions from last
weekend's project in this read me folder.
